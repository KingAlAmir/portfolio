## My Journey

My cybersecurity journey began with a curiosity for bypassing physical locks, which evolved into a fascination with digital systems' intricacies. This hobby led me to contribute significantly to my high school's network and policy security, laying the foundational skills that would later define my career path.

Despite initially aiming for web development, the discovery of cybersecurity as a formal discipline reignited my passion. Accepting the challenge, I dove headfirst into rigorous coursework, securing a coveted internship spot at Spark NZ among a highly competitive pool of candidates. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of ethical, legal, and policy aspects of cybersecurity.

From dual booting my first computer at age 10 to establishing my own network "lab," my journey has been characterized by a deep love for learning, exploration, and pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone. My "I can" mindset has propelled me through various challenges, shaping me into the cybersecurity professional I am today.
